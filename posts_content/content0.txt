How did this subject come about? Well, let's just say that I have a knack for asking difficult and/or weird questions(not necessarily useful ones, now that's a whole 'nother matter).
				Without going too far into the weeds, I aim to answer the following questions:
					How does the language we speak influence our thought process?
					Is there such a thing as a more 'rational' language?
					Is there such a thing as a least-redundant language?
					And finally, do multilingual people think differently compared to monolingual people?
