				<p>How did this subject come about? Well, let's just say that I have a knack for asking difficult and/or weird questions(not necessarily useful ones, now that's a whole 'nother matter).</p>
				<p> Without going too far into the weeds, I aim to answer the following questions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How does the language we speak influence our thought process?</li>
					<li>Is there such a thing as a more 'rational' language? </li>
					<li>Is there such a thing as a least-redundant language?</li>
					<li> And finally, do multilingual people think differently compared to monolingual people?</li>
				</ul>
